      "reasoning puzzle meant to be different from any other puzzle – an AI would  \n",
      "have to approach it from scratch, only leveraging the same kind of prior  \n",
      "knowledge about the world as what humans innately possess (\"Core  \n",
      "Knowledge\"). State-of-the-art deep learning models (including large  \n",

      "Our 2020 competition (ARC 1) was an exciting success – more than nine  \n",
      "hundred teams competed to build algorithms that could solve novel reasoning  \n",
